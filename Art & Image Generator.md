### DALL·E 3
<details><summary>Introduction</summary>
DALL·E 3 is an advanced text-to-image generation system that understands context and nuances, allowing users to transform their ideas into precise visuals. This technology surpasses its predecessors by producing images that closely mirror and adhere to textual descriptions provided by the user. DALL·E 3 is built natively on ChatGPT, enabling it to use ChatGPT as a brainstorming partner and refiner of prompts. It introduces two new styles: 'natural' and 'vivid', where 'vivid' generates hyper-real and cinematic images, and 'natural' produces more natural, less hyper-real looking images. It also introduces new parameters for image quality and style, and a feature called 'prompt rewriting' that optimizes prompts before they're passed to DALL·E. DALL·E 3 can be used in various applications, from creating compelling ad posters to designing infographics, and even in game development. It's a significant advancement in the field of AI, providing users with a tool that can generate images that match their descriptions with high precision </details>
